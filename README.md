ðŸ¤– Pragya Assist
Pragya Assist is a personal project I built â€” an AI-powered chatbot that can talk with users in both Hindi and English, using voice input and output. Itâ€™s designed to be empathetic and helpful, with a clean UI and voice capabilities to make it feel more human-like.

The chatbot runs on Flask and uses AI models via OpenRouter, with support for text-to-speech, speech recognition, and translation to handle bilingual conversations.

ðŸ“Œ Why I Built This
I wanted to build something practical using AI and voice technologies â€” and also support both Hindi and English, since those are widely spoken in India. This project helped me apply Python, Flask, and AI APIs in a fun and useful way.
